# knowyourweather

A web app to show the current weather all around the world. Design is not mine.

## Development

The front-end are just a combination of `EJS` and `CSS`, while the back-end is constructed using `Node.js`
I use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and with a bit of wizardry, it becomes like this.
