A web app to show the current weather all around the world. Design is not mine.

## Development

The front-end are just a combination of `EJS` and `CSS`, while the back-end is constructed using `Node.js`
I use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and with a bit of wizardry, it becomes like this.

## Running

To run this source code, simply run `npm install` to download the necessary node packages inside of the `package.json` dependencies and changed the `config.MY_API_KEY` to your own OpenWeatherMap API Key. I use heroku to host this so I stored the key inside of the config vars.
